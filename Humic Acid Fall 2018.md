## Abstract
The Fall 2018 Humic acid Team will focus on testing the effluent humic acid concentration changes as coagulant dosage increases for influent humic acid at 5mg/L, 10mg/L and 15mg/L trials. The new AccuView spectrophotometer will be used to measure the flow absorbance and corresponding species concentrations will be calculated from recorded absorbances with Beer's Law. The team expects to develop better understanding of humic acid concentration changes through the overall experimental system and how humic acid particles interact with clay particles inside the sedimentation model. This research will help AguaClara gain more knowledge of how Natural Organic Matter (NOM) interacts with coagulant in water.


## Introduction
Natural Organic Matter (NOM) exists in ground and surface waters with various chemical compositions. It is dipolar and can serve as a nutrient for bacteria, viruses, and pathogens, encouraging their re-germination processes. Additionally, NOM produces carcinogenic by-products during the degradation process. It then becomes imperative to remove NOM in water. The amount of NOM in raw water supplies is greater in areas such as Northern Europe and North America. However, there isn't a robust model predicting how NOM behaves in water and thus, there are not effective treatment methods for NOM removal. Limited knowledge in this area affects drinking water treatment significantly. Many researchers believe the role of NOM in water might call for a need to increase coagulant doses.


The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam investigated the optimal coagulant dosage for certain humic acid inffluent concentrations and results are shown in Table 1 below:

Table 1: Results from Spring 2018 Humic Acid Team




| Humic Acid Concentration(mg/L) | Optimal Coagulant Dosage(mg/L) |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 5                              | 1.6-1.8                        |
| 10                             | 1.3                            |


Even though the humic acid concentration doubled, the difference between optimal coagulant dosages was negligible. Therefore, the Team decided to change our research path. Instead of continuing to test optimal coagulant dosage for different humic acid concentrations, the Fall 2018 Team investigated how effluent humic acid concentration changes as coagulant dosage increases at a certain humic acid influent concentration. To determine the effluent humic acid concentration, the Team used AccuView spectrophotometer to measure the flow absorbance and calculated the concentration of corresponding species in the flow with Beer's Law. The results of these experiments enabled the Team to develop relationships between effluent humic acid concentrations and coagulant dosages for a certain humic acid influent concentration. With more available information of NOM in local water supplies, AguaClara could better adjust the coagulant dosage to achieve lower effluent turbidities and save money on coagulant.

In terms of importance to the world in general, the coagulant concentration should not be too high because it is expensive and potentially harmful to the water quality. Too much coagulant will prevent flocculation which is counter-productive. Too little coagulant means the water still potentially has significant levels of humic acid, which will be problematic once chlorine is used to kill bacteria in the water. The humic acid and chlorine will react to form chloroform which is very harmful to humans (Kopfler, F et al.).



## Literature Review
NOM negatively affects water quality in a number of ways. It causes discoloration, taste and odor problems, and biological growth in distribution systems. It also increases the concentration of heavy metals and absorbed organic pollutants. The increased particles in water consequently cause an increase in sludge volumes. Matilainen et al. suggests that optimized coagulation is the major treatment option in decreasing NOM level (2010). However, the nature of NOM has significant effects on the removal efficiency of coagulation. Additionally, the hydrophobic portion of NOM is generally removed more effectively with coagulation than the hydrophilic portion is. The removal efficiency of NOM also depends on several factors such as pH, temperature and coagulant type.

Regarding NOM removal efficiency, Soh et al. isolated dissolved NOM into four organic fractions based on their hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties (very hydrophobic acids, slightly hydrophobic acids, charged hydrophilics, and neutral hydrophilics) (2008). His experiment was designed to determine the impact of alum coagulation on removal of these fractions in conventional water treatment. He found that the alum removed mostly hydrophobic and higher molecular weight components of NOM. This result further verified that the NOM removal efficiency is correlated with the properties of NOM. His study also revealed that, even though alum coagulation removed a large proportion of NOM, a significant amount of the NOM resisted coagulation as well. This implies that NOM removal will not improve significantly at very high coagulant dosage.

Because of the aforementioned factors, such as pH value, that influence NOM removal efficiency, the team needed to design well-controlled experiments to avoid any unexpected variables affecting experimental results. The studies that have been conducted in related fields provide inspiration for experiments the team conducted this semester, such as exploring the optimal coagulant dosage (the dosage which yields the lowest effluent turbidity) at a certain humic acid concentration. Previous research had focused on the general affect of coagulation on humic acid and the subcomponents of NOM, but there have been no comprehensive studies conducted on optimal dosages. As such, this was the primary research focus of then team.


Another research more relevant to current Humic Acid Team is from Yingda Du, a former graduate student at Cornell, was the first to experiment with how effluent turbidity is affected by a combination of coagulant concentration and humic acid concentration. Her thesis paper investigates the effects NOM has on flocculation. Particle size distribution of flocs and effluent turbidity are the two major criteria for determining the effectiveness of flocculation. These two parameters are affected by the concentration of NOM in the system. In order to model this system, humic acid, which is one of the major components of NOM, serves as the surrogate for NOM. Du hypothesized that variation in humic acid concentration will affect floc size distribution and effluent turbidity. In her thesis, she modeled the effects of humic acid in high turbidity water on flocculation. For influent turbidity at 50 NTU with coagulant dosage ranging from 0.53mg/L to 2.65mg/L and humic acid concentration ranging from 0 to 15mg/L, a series of experiments from Yingda indicate that the coagulant dosage is positively correlated with turbidity reduction and the presence of humic acid greatly increases the effluent turbidity. This was same for every experiment. An increase in coagulant dosage decreased the settled water turbidity.

Another finding from Du's report is that the presence of humic acid increases the frequency of smaller particles after flocculation. As humic acid coats coagulant nano-particles, the attachment efficiency of collisions will decrease. Thus, humic acid can change the particle size distribution of the precipitated solids and larger particle formation is greatly inhibited by humic acid. This result indicates that existence of humic acid particles could diminish the performance of flocculation/sedimentation process with higher effluent turbidity.


## Previous Work
The Humic Acid Team was established in Fall 2017 and in that semester, the team members tested the optimal coagulant dosage at 5mg/L humic acid influent concentration and obtained 1.6mg/L as the optimal coagulant dosage. However, as the team only conducted experiment for one humic acid influent concentration, no substantial conclusion was drawn.

The Spring 2018 Humic Acid subteam verified the previous semester's result and tested optimal coagulant dosages for 5m/L and 10mg/L HA concentrations. The results are shown in Table 1 above. As the HA concentration increases, the optimal coagulant dosage drops down slightly. However, the team cannot conclude that the increasing of HA concentration will decrease the optimal coagulant dosage, as a wider range of HA concentrations should be tested. In addition, the team found that for one trial, the head loss through the flocculator accumulates with time. This phenomenon might explain why the effluent turbidity rises up again after the experiment reaches steady state.



## Methods
#### Experimental Apparatus

###### Sedimentation Tank Model

<img src="https://github.com/AguaClara/humic_acid/blob/master/Tubesettler.jpg?raw=true" height=300 width=300>

Figure 1: Sedimentation Tank Model


To standardize with setup of other dissolved species sub-teams, the team also used PVC pipe to mimic the sedimentation tank. 1-inch clear PVC pipe was chosen and fabricated so that the experimental apparatus had a 50 cm recirculator (14) and 35 cm tube settler(15). The floc weir was 40 cm and the bent angle of tube settler was angled 60 degrees relative the horizontal. The length of the tube settler was determined so that a capture velocity of .308 mm/s would be achieved within the reactor. The design was obtained from High Rate Sedimentation sub-team.

###### Other Apparatus
<img src="https://github.com/AguaClara/humic_acid/blob/master/humic_acid_2018_fall_apparatus.png?raw=true" height = 300 width = 400>

Figure 2: Other apparatus consisting of pumps, turbidimeters, flocculator and a spectrophotometer.

Four pumps (1,2,3,7) were used to drive the tap water, clay water (8), humic acid solution (10) and coagulant solution(12) respectively. Two turbidimeters (5,6) were used to measure the turbidity of influent (5) and effluent (6) streams. The flocculator(4) was constructed by the Spring 2018 High G Flocculation Team with 100ft PVC tubing.

First, the water pump (1) pumps DI-water into the system where it flows into the flow accumulator (11). Clay water (8) is added to the stream immediately after the accumulator and  it then enters the influent turbidimeter (5). The turbidimeter and the clay pump work together with ProCoDA to regulate the amount of clay pumped into the system, so that influent NTU hovers around 100. The coagulant (12) is added to the stream afterwards, right before the solution enters the flocculator (4).The flocculator accelerates the solution as to maximize clay coagulant collisions. The solution then flows in the recirculator and tube settler. Once the floc blanket forms, clean water flows through the effluent turbidimeter.

The AccuView spectrophotometer was added into the experimental apparatus to measure the effluent humic acid turbidity. The spectrophotometer was installed after the effluent turbidimeter and the outlet of spectrophotometer was connected to the waste water line. The measurement reading was set in the unit of absorbance(ABS) at 254 nm. The spectrophotometer was calibrated with DI water beforehand


######Complications
There were complications in integrating the spectrophotometer into the system and there was leaking problem at the spectrophotometer's inlet. The team then realized that the tubing ends were not smooth and did not fit into the push connectors well, allowing water to leak from the system.  The short rough ends of the tubing were cut off and then reconnected to the spectrophotometer, resolving the leaking water issue.

#### Experimental Methods

To start the experiment on measuring the effluent humic acid concentration, the Fall 2018 Humic Acid Team needed to investigate how to convert the spectrophotometer absorbance reading to humic acid concentration. Because both clay and humic acid particles contribute to the absorbance reading, the team decided to start three preliminary experiments before testing the effluent humic acid concentration as coagulant concentration changes.

The first preliminary experiment is to confirm that humic acid particles will obey Beer's Law which could be use for the future. Since the spectrophotometer was not installed properly in the beginning of the semester, the team used the 1600 UV spectrophotometer in the design lab to measure the absorbance for 5mg/L, 10mg/L and 15mg/L humic acid solution. The results were analyzed afterwards.

The second preliminary test is to develop a relationship between the clay solution turbidity and absorbance. The team used the ProCoDA to control clay solution turbidity  at 10NTU, 20NTU and 30NTU and then measured the absorbance respectively. The importance of the second preliminary test is with the assumption that only clay particles affect the effluent turbidity reading, the team can calculate the clay absorbance based on the effluent turbidity and subtract the clay absorbance from the total absorbance to get the pure humic acid absorbance. This assumption could be further confirmed by the third preliminary test.

Figure 3: The schematic for the second preliminary test

In the third preliminary test, the team used humic acid solution with known concentrations(5mg/L, 10mg/L and 15mg/L) to run though the turbidimeter  and AccuView spectrophotometer. The relationship between the humic acid concentration and absorbance can be found as the first preliminary test indicated that humic acid solution obeys Beer's Law. This test could also confirm the team assumption that only clay particles affect the effluent turbidity reading was valid, if the turbidimeter reading was negligible.

After the three preliminary tests, the team conducted the designed experiments in which the team tested effluent humic acid concentration changes as coagulant dosage increased from 0.5mg/L to 2mg/L at 5mg/L, 10mg/L and 15mg/L influent humic acid concentrations.


### Procedure
The first preliminary test was conducted to ensure that the absorbance of humic acid obeys Beer’s law.   The UV-1600PC Spectrophotometer in the Design Lab was used for this set of experiments.

* Warm the spectrophotometer for 10 minutes.
* Calibrate the cuvette with DI-Water at 254 nm, the absorbance wavelength for humic acid
* Prepare Humic Acid samples with the following concentrations using stock humic acid and DI-Water:
  (1)5 mg/L
  (2)10 mg/L
  (3)15 mg/L
* Measure the absorbance of the samples one by one, recording the measured absorbances for the respective humic acid samples.

The following experiments help to determine the relationship between various influent mixtures and the corresponding absorbances.
* Clean the flocculator tube and the effluent turbidimeter
* Drain the recirculation unit
* Input the species concentration into the MathCAD sheet for PACl dosing, which outputs the necessary pump speed
* Fill the clay bucket with 4-5 liters of water and add Kaolin clay to the bucket (2-3 scoops/exact amount isn't important because clay concentration is   controlled by ProCoDA)
* Turn on the clay pump and the water pump. The clay pump is controlled by ProCoDa and other pumps are controlled on manually by pressing the switch.The water pump is generally running at 50 RPM.
* The clay pump should be around 30-40 rpm maximum, and at the end of the experiment the effluent turbidity should be low (less than 3 NTU) and in a steady state.
* Record data when the experiment reaches steady state.
* Stop the experiment by shutting down all the running pumps, turbidimeters and the clay stir.





## Results and Analysis

Following the first preliminary experiment, the data points collected were plotted on an Absorbance vs. Concentration of Humic Acid graph, shown below.  This was done in order to confirm that the data collected obey Beer's Law.


The plot was created by python code and code can be found in the "Python Code" section.

<img src="https://github.com/AguaClara/humic_acid/blob/master/test1.png?raw=true" height=250 width=400>

Figure 4: The results for preliminary test #1.  The linear relationship between humic acid absorbance and the concentration of humic acid shows that Beer's Law is upheld and that spectrophotometry can be used in future tests.

The plot of Absorbance at 254 nm vs. Concentration of Humic Acid is linear.  This is expected because the graph should follow Beer’s Law, which states that absorbance is proportional to the concentration of the species.  If a linear trend line is plotted for the graph above, the slope will be the absorptivity constant times the length of the light path.  Since the Beer’s Law relationship was confirmed with the species used in this experiment, future experiments can be conducted to calculate concentration, given that the absorption, absorptivity constant, and path length are known.

From the first preliminary experiment, it was confirmed that humic acid molecules obey Beer's Law. The humic acid solutions with known concentrations were then run through the AccuView spectrophotometer and corresponding absorbances were measured.

The plot was created by python code and code can be found in the "Python Code" section.

Figure 5: The results from preliminary test #2.  The linear relationship derived between clay absorbance and clay turbidity can be used to extrapolate the absorbances of other clay turbidities.

In Figure 5, the plot is also linear because humic Acid obeys Beer's Law. The slope of the plot, however, is different from that of Figure 4 because the AccuView spectrophotometer has different path length from the UV-spectrophotometer in the design lab. This Figure is essential for the future experiments as by knowing the effluent humic acid  absorbance, the effluent humic acid concentration can be read from the graph.

Nevertheless, to find the effluent humic acid absorbance, the effluent clay absorbance needs to be found and subtracted from the total effluent absorbance. With the assumption that humic acid particles have negligible contribution towards the turbidity, the effluent turbidity can be considered as effluent clay turbidity. Therefore, the third preliminary experiment tends to develop relationship between the clay turbidity and absorbance. Clay-water samples with different turbidity were run through the AccuView spectrophotometer and corresponding absorbances were recorded.

The plot was created by python code and code can be found in the "Python Code" section.

<img src="https://github.com/AguaClara/humic_acid/blob/master/test3.png?raw=true" height=250 width=400>

Figure 6: The results from preliminary test #3. The linear relationship derived between humic acid absorbance and humic acid concentration can be used to extrapolate the absorbances of other humic acid samples.  These results also confirm the results of prelimnary test 1 for the new spectrophotometer.

As seen in Figure 6 above, there is a linear relationship between clay turbidity and absorbance.  This relationship will be important in later experiments when the clay absorbance is determined from the turbidimeter reading.  By measuring the turbidity of clay in an effluent stream, the clay's absorbance can be calculated from the relationship derived in the graph.  This value can then be subtracted from the overall absorbance to find the absorbance of humic acid, which is the end goal.  



## Conclusions
The first preliminary test indicated that humic acid solution obeys the Beer's Law.  The results from this test prove that the spectrophotometer could be used in the future to determine humic acid concentration.

The results from the second preliminary test proved that humic acid samples run through the experimental apparatus also follow Beer's Law relationship.  Through linear regression, the linear relationship between humic acid concentration and its absorbance was obtained:
y = 0.227x + 0.262

Where y is the abosrbance and x is the concentration of humic acid.  Since Beer's Law is upheld by this experiment,  spectrophotometry can therefore be utilized to analyze absorbances of humic acid in the system.

The results from the third preliminary test showed that the clay turbidity and the absorbance of clay are related linearly.  The relationship was obtained:
y = 0.0199x + 0.0554

Where y is the absorbance of clay and x is the turbidity.  This relationship was derived by performing a linear regression on the data collected in test 3.  This relationship has big implications for the team's future work: by measuring the effluent turbidity of a clay-humic-acid sample, the absorbance of the clay can be calculated using the equation above.  The absorbance of clay can be subtracted from the total absorbance reading from the spectrophotometer, yielding the humic acid absorbance in the stream.  Ultimately, this calculation will allow for future work in determining effluent humic acid concentration and the effectiveness of the treatment process for humic acid.

## Future Work

The team will build a recycle experimental system to test the absorbance of clay-humic acid samples and investigate if their absorbances are additive. Experiments will be run with samples containing humic acid and clay with known concentrations. By the data obtained through the preliminary tests, the absorbances of humic acid and clay in known concentrations can be determined and the sum will be compared with the result from the recycled system.  The results of these experiments will help determine whether the absorbance of humic acid in an effluent stream can be calculated by subtracting the clay absorbance from the total effluent absorbance.  In the end, the relationship discovered among these three absorbances (humic-acid-only influent, a clay-only influent, and a mix of clay and humic acid influent) will help the team explore the humic acid concentration change in the effluent and eventually allow AguaClara plants to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of current water treatment processes.

# Manual

### Experimental Methods
### Set-up
* Choose the experimental set-up to standardize with other particle-removal subteams. Construct the recirculator and flocculator. The recirculator was constructed from clear PVC piping. The floc weir was attached to the recirculator with adhesive. The flocculator is made from plastic tubing, which is coiled around a cardboard cylinder.

* Set up ProCoDA by determining what pumps and turbidimeters needed to be controlled based on experimentation purposes. For this experiment,  The humic acid, water, and coagulant are pumped at constant rates, so they don't need to be controlled directly by ProCoDA.Turn on or off these pumps manually by pressing the block switch on the pump. The turbidimeters and pressure sensor are also linked to ProCoDA to collect output data. On the other hand, the clay pump does need to be controlled by ProCoDA because the influent turbidity should keep at 100NTU. The clay pump is on while the ProCoDA program is operating.


### Experiment
* Collect data through ProCoDA and upload to Google Drive
- The experiment run time varies so that stock solutions need to be prepared to last for at least 20-hour run time.
* Experimental designs are adjusted based on results
- For example, if the run time is longer than our expectation, the dilution factor for the stock solution can be changed so the experiment has more time to reach steady state.
* Multiple trials are conducted
- To verify data is able to be reproduced, multiple trials for each coagulant concentration should be carried out, and the results should be compared for consistency in effluent turbidity.
* Data Analysis
- This consists of looking at the excel sheet of data, and searching for the steady state in the data, which is where the effluent turbidity reaches a constant value. Then the data is plotted from the start of the experiment until the steady state ends.
* Note any observations and results while experimenting.




### Cleaning Procedure
* Clean flocculator: insert a tiny piece of sponge into one end of flocculator and connect that end to tap water by a push connecter. Turn on the sink and let the sponge run through. This should be done after every trial.
* Clean turbidimeter: take out the glass vial from the turbidimeter and wash the vial using soap and a brush. Wipe the vial before putting it back into the turbidimeter. This should be done after every trial. The glass vial in the turbidimeter should be cleaned with Kimwipes before returning the vial to the turbidimeter, because the Kimwipes remove any fingerprints and potential interference to passing light through the clear vial. If the vial isn't cleaned properly, the effluent turbidity will likely appear higher than it actually is, because fingerprints will lower transmittance of light through the glass vial, which is how the turbidimeter measures turbidity. The less light that passes through the vial, the higher the effluent turbidity, because cloudy water prevents light from completely passing through to the other side of the vial. Fingerprints would essentially act like cloudy water in this case, and prevent light from passing through the vial, thus increasing the effluent turbidity.


## Experimental Checklist
Before starting the experiment:
* Make sure ProCoDA is connected, and appropriately set up for data collection
Check that the stock solutions are adequately filled
Check that all tubing is connected properly, and no leaks are present in the system


For ~5 minutes after starting the experiment:
* Make sure the influent turbidity has stabilized around 100 NTU
* Also check that the clay pump is below 80 RPM

Later during the experiment:
* Floc blankets should have formed in the recirculator
* Check that there is still coagulant, clay and humic acid in their respective containers
* Ensure that effluent turbidity is getting significantly lower as time progresses
